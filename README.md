Overview
====

This repository is a collection of scripts that can be used with knife exec.

Usage
====

Simply point knife exec at the desired script in this directory.

    knife exec knife-scripts/$SCRIPT_NAME.rb

Individual Scripts
----

The scripts are intended to be simple and straightforward to use. This section describes additional configuration when required.

# `chef_server_backup.rb`

This script backs up the following data from the Chef Server.

* nodes
* roles
* data bags and items

This script will use `.chef/chef_server_backup` as the default directory to backup the data to, but you can change the location by setting `knife[:chef_server_backup_dir]` in `.chef/knife.rb`. For example:

    knife[:chef_server_backup_dir] = "/home/username/chef_backups"

Cookbooks are not backed up as they are assumed to already be in the chef-repo and can be uploaded using `knife cookbook upload -a`. Clients are not backed up as they should be reregistered using the validation certificate of the new Opscode Platform organization or other Chef Server.
